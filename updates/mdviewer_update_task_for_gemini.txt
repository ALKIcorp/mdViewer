MD VIEWER UPDATE TASK – BLOCK PANEL + EXPORT OPTIONS

Context
- This project already has a working markdown editor + live preview UI in a dark theme.
- The current layout is a two‑panel view: editor on the left, rendered markdown preview on the right.
- You must KEEP the existing behaviour (free typing markdown, live preview, current styling), and ADD the new features described below without breaking what already works.

High‑level Goal
- Add a collapsible panel on the left side of the app that lets the user build documents using formatted building blocks (title, section heading, text, code, etc.).
- Each block type shows a visual preview of how it will look, using shared sample text.
- Add export buttons that let the user export the current markdown document as: .md, .docx, and .pdf.
- Add hover tooltips for the new buttons and for the block descriptions. No click‑based popups.

Layout and Flex Behaviour
- The app should use a flexbox layout so that the new left panel, the existing editor, and the preview adjust dynamically.
- When the left panel is OPEN:
  - The left side of the screen is split into two vertical sections: the new block panel and the existing editor.
  - The preview remains on the right side, similar to how it behaves now.
- When the left panel is CLOSED:
  - The app should behave like it does currently: editor and preview as the main split view, with no extra column.
- The layout must remain responsive and usable on smaller window sizes.

Left Panel Toggle
- Add a button that opens and closes the left block panel.
- Place the toggle in a logical, easy‑to‑discover location (for example, near the top of the layout).
- The toggle must:
  - Visually indicate whether the panel is open or closed.
  - Have a hover tooltip that briefly explains its function (for example: “Show block tools” / “Hide block tools”).
- The toggle must work without reloading the page or resetting the existing markdown content.

Left Panel: Sample Text Input
- At the top of the left panel, add a single text input field that represents “sample text”.
- This field should:
  - Use a default value that reads: ALKI Corp MD Viewer
  - Be editable by the user.
- Label this input clearly with “Sample text”:
  - The label should be in a darker grey tone so it is visible but subtle against the dark background.
- Behaviour:
  - The current value of this sample text field must be used in all block previews further down in the left panel.
  - When the user updates the sample text, all previews in the panel should update automatically to reflect the new value (no page refresh).

Block Types (Format Blocks)
- Inside the left panel, display a vertical list of block types.
- Each block type is represented as a “card” with:
  - A block title (for example: “Title”, “Section Title”, “Text”, “Code Block” – actual labels are up to you but should be short and clear).
  - A small “?” icon next to the block title.
  - A description tooltip that appears only when the “?” icon is hovered.
  - A preview area that shows what that block would look like when rendered, using the current sample text.

Required block types:
1) Big Title block
   - Represents the main document title style.
   - Preview content:
     - Use the sample text as the title content.
     - Rendered to match how the main title would look in the final document (larger font, bold, etc., consistent with the existing theme).
   - This block is intended for the document’s main title.

2) Section Title block
   - Represents a section heading style.
   - Preview content:
     - Use the sample text as the section heading content.
     - Render it as a smaller heading than the main title but still visually prominent.
   - This block is intended for numbered or named sections.

3) Text block
   - Represents a normal paragraph of body text.
   - Preview content:
     - Use the sample text as the paragraph content.
     - Rendered as standard body text according to the app’s typography.

4) Code block
   - Represents a fenced code block with a language label.
   - The block configuration must allow specifying a language string (for example: bash, dart, etc.).
   - Preview content:
     - Use the sample text inside the code area.
     - Display it using the existing code styling (monospaced, code background, etc.).
     - Show the language label visually in whatever way is currently used for syntax highlighting (or add one if none exists).
   - This preview is for visual demonstration only; it should not run any commands.

Optional block type (only if straightforward to add):
5) Bullet list block
   - Represents a basic bullet list.
   - Preview content:
     - Split the sample text in a simple, reasonable way (for example, one line per bullet) and render a short bullet list for preview purposes.
   - Keep it simple and avoid overcomplicating parsing logic.

Block Card Behaviour
- Each block card must show:
  - The block name (title).
  - A “?” icon directly beside the title.
  - A short description of what the block does and when to use it, shown ONLY on hover over the “?” icon.
- Tooltip behaviour for the “?” icon:
  - Display a small, lightweight tooltip near the icon.
  - The tooltip must appear only while the cursor is hovered on the “?” icon.
  - The tooltip must disappear automatically as soon as the cursor leaves the icon area.
  - Do not use modals, alert boxes, or click‑to‑open dialogs for these descriptions.
- Below the title and description area, show the preview of the rendered block, using the current sample text.
- The preview is purely visual and is NOT directly editable from inside the card.

Interaction with the Main Editor
- The existing markdown editor remains the primary place where the user edits the actual document text.
- Extend the block cards so the user can insert a block into the document:
  - Add a clear control on each block card (for example, a button) that, when clicked, inserts the corresponding block structure into the current document.
  - Insertion should use the current sample text as placeholder content, which the user can then edit directly in the editor.
  - Insertion should happen at the current cursor position in the editor if possible; if not, it can safely append to the end of the document.
- The live preview on the right side should continue to reflect the markdown in the editor as it changes, including blocks inserted via the left panel.

Export Options (MD, DOCX, PDF)
- Add export controls for the current markdown document.
- Required export formats:
  - Markdown (.md)
  - Word document (.docx)
  - PDF (.pdf)
- The export buttons should:
  - Use the current markdown content from the editor as the single source of truth.
  - Generate the corresponding file type using that content.
  - Trigger a standard file download in the browser for each format.
- Implementation notes:
  - If there is already export logic (for example, for markdown or PDF), reuse and extend it instead of rewriting from scratch.
  - Add any necessary client‑side or server‑side conversions for DOCX and PDF as needed, but keep the interface clean for the user: they just click a button and receive the file.
- UI and tooltips:
  - Place the export buttons together in a logical toolbar area.
  - Each export button must have a hover tooltip that clearly states what it does (for example: “Download as Markdown”, “Download as DOCX”, “Download as PDF”).
  - Tooltips must appear only on hover and disappear when the cursor leaves, without requiring any clicks.

Hover Text and Clean UX Requirements
- All hover‑based help must:
  - Appear quickly when the user hovers over the relevant icon or button.
  - Disappear automatically when the cursor moves away.
  - Not block clicks or interactions with other parts of the UI.
- No modal dialogs, no click‑to‑close popups, and no persistent overlays for these descriptions.
- The design should stay consistent with the existing dark theme:
  - Use subtle contrast (for example, dark grey labels on darker backgrounds) so labels are visible but not distracting.
  - Make sure tooltips and previews remain legible on the dark background.

General Quality Notes
- Do not remove or break any existing features of the markdown viewer.
- Keep the code organized and readable; group the new panel, block definitions, and export logic in logical modules or components.
- The final result should feel like a seamless extension of the current app: same theme, same UX style, just with an additional powerful left panel and clear export options.
